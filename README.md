# Machine Setup Homebrew Formulae

Most of the time, you'll be following setup steps after you're added to the Github organization. Assuming you've installed [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) using the script on their site:

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    $ git clone https://github.com/minifast/setup
    ```

2. Install dependencies using Homebrew:

    ```bash
    $ cd setup
    $ brew bundle
    ```

Some text will show up for the party, and then you'll have a configured machine!


## How do I install these formulae as one-offs?

`brew install minifast/setup/<formula>`

Or `brew tap minifast/setup` and then `brew install <formula>`.


## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
